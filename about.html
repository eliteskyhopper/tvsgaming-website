                    <h1>About us</h1>
                    <p>Hello guys, this is the main website of The Villian Syndicate which is a new YouTube channel. We focus on <em>Let's Play</em> videos and other gaming-related stuff. We are a community-driven channel, and we have a Group of Content Creators. We have though currently run into problems concerning someone deleting our videos so we are currently working on getting that back up.</p>
                    <p>We do all kinds of games, but currently we are focusing on free-to-play or cheap games as our funds aren't too large. If you would like to help us out you could donate games or money, of course you will be given credit for this in our videos. If you want to become a member of our team, contact us through our <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/VillianSyndicate">Steam Group</a>.</p>
                    <p>We are currently a Non-Profit Organization, but we do have a sponsor, and all the money earned goes to the channel and not into the owner's pocket.</p>
                    <p>We have a team of 8 people currently, even though we might have to cut a few members due to them being inactive.</p>
